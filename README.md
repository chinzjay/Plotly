# Plotly
## Overview
The purpose of this project is to help Roza create a visualization of the bacterial data for each volunteer so that they can identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons.
## Results
Following are the updates made to the completed dashboard.
- A horizontal bar chart to display the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu on the webpage *(Fig 1)*.

- The dashboard hass been customized to make the webpage more appealing.

## Summary
Using JavaScript, Plotly, and D3.js, the dashboard was updated to display the demographics panel and the various charts to display the bacterial species that lives in the individual's belly button when the ID is selected from the dropdown menu. The following customizations can be made to make the dashboard more dynamic and appealing.

- Navigation bar can be added that allows the user to select the various charts on the page.
- Each graph can be updated to add further information on the types of bacteria residing in each individual.
